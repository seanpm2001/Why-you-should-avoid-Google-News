Google search has a feature known as Google News. It is a news aggregator. It also has an app that is separate from the Google search engine. Unfortunately, like other Google products, it has severe problems with bias. Similar to the functioning of the YouTube algorithm, the Google News algorithm gives results that may be extreme and isolating.
